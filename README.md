<u>Interesting Facts About Productivity</u> <br><br>
The Zeigarnik Effect:<br> This psychological phenomenon states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. This is why a to-do list can be so effective—it allows your mind to let go of the mental burden of remembering tasks once they're written down.

The Pomodoro Technique: <br> A popular time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Organizing your to-do list is the first step of this technique.

Productivity Tools: <br> A study by McKinsey found that social technologies and collaboration tools could raise the productivity of knowledge workers by 20–25%. The right digital tools can significantly enhance your workflow.
