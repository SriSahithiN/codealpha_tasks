Objective <br> <br>

************************ <br>

Key Features <br><br>
Precise Age Calculation:<br> Users can input their date of birth to get their exact age broken down into years, months, and days.

Total Time Lived:<br>The calculator dynamically displays the total number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds the user has been alive, with real-time animated counters for an engaging visual effect.

Next Birthday Countdown:<br> A live countdown shows precisely how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds remain until the user's next birthday, building anticipation.

Zodiac Signs:<br> Automatically determines and displays both the user's Western Zodiac Sign and their Chinese Zodiac Animal based on their birth date and year.

Year Progress Bar:<br> A visual progress bar indicates what percentage of the current year has passed for the user, offering a unique perspective on time.

Fun Facts:<br> Provides an interesting historical or pop culture fact tied to the user's birth year, adding an element of discovery.

Life Milestones:<br> Displays personalized life milestones or insights based on the user's current age, offering a reflective touch.

Comparative Age:<br> Users can input a second date of birth to compare their age with another person, showing the exact difference in years, months, and days.

Data Persistence & Sharing:<br><br>

Local Storage:<br> The application remembers the user's last entered birth date using local storage, so it's pre-filled on subsequent visits.

Shareable Link:<br> Users can generate a unique URL that embeds their birth date, allowing them to easily share their age and insights with others. A custom message confirms when the link has been copied to the clipboard.

This modern web application is a feature-rich, single-page To-Do List designed for optimal productivity and organization. It combines clean aesthetics with powerful functionality, allowing you to manage your tasks effectively.

<u>Key Features:</u> <br><br>
Task Management:<br>Add new tasks with details like due dates, priority levels, and custom categories.

Subtasks:<br> Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks to stay organized.

Drag-and-Drop:<br> Easily reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them to change their priority or sequence.

Filtering & Sorting:<br> Filter tasks by "All," "Active," or "Completed" status. You can also sort your list by priority or due date.

Search Functionality:<br> Quickly find any task using the search bar, which checks the main task title, categories, and subtasks.

Visual Progress Bar:<br> A progress bar at the top of the page visually tracks your completion percentage, giving you a sense of accomplishment.

Dark Mode:<br> A one-click toggle allows you to switch between a light and dark theme for a better viewing experience in different environments.

Persistent Storage:<br> All tasks are saved automatically to your browser's local storage, ensuring your list remains intact even if you close the tab.

<u>Interesting Facts About Productivity</u> <br><br>
The Zeigarnik Effect:<br> This psychological phenomenon states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. This is why a to-do list can be so effective—it allows your mind to let go of the mental burden of remembering tasks once they're written down.

The Pomodoro Technique: <br> A popular time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Organizing your to-do list is the first step of this technique.

Productivity Tools: <br> A study by McKinsey found that social technologies and collaboration tools could raise the productivity of knowledge workers by 20–25%. The right digital tools can significantly enhance your workflow.
